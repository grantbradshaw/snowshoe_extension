Snowshoe
=========

Lighthouse Labs - Final Project
-------

Snowshoe is a customizable web scraper to track prices on the web. As you browse, keep track of interesting products you find (for instance, that you might give as a gift), and be told when they are on sale (or expensive, I guess). Products are displayed in the [backend](https://github.com/grantbradshaw/snowshoe).

## Features

- [Extension](https://github.com/grantbradshaw/scrape_extension) allows selecting prices for tracking across many webpages.
- Customize conditions for tracks.
- Automatic scraping on a regular schedule.
- When track conditions are met, users receive an email notification.

Snowshoe is built on Node.js (with the Express framework), MongoDB, and a [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/grantbradshaw/scrape_extension) built in JS. We jumpstarted the project by using the Hackathon Starter project on Github.
